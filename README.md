# memory-game

Simon Game is made up using  C++ for the logic and TGui library for  GUI  for doing the graphical interface and for playing the audio

Game logic :

-it has a start button in the middle of the screen and 4 colored button around the middle 

-The game shows the sequence by lighting up one of the buttons for 0.5 seconds and playing one of the 4 music notes.

-Once the program has shown the sequence, the user must then click the 4 color buttons
in the same order that the program generated. If the user presses the correct sequence, then the program adds one more color to the sequence and you repeat.

-If the user types in a wrong color that is not the next one in the sequence, 
If the user doesnâ€™t hit a button within 5 seconds of the last button they hit then the game is over
